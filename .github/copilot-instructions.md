- Keep in mind that the validation code needs to work on the trustoverip/spec-up-t repo and also on the GitHubUi repo
- When implementing a new healthcheck in spec-up-t repo, also implement it in GitHubUi
- All code will have to pass SonarQube analysis
- A very modular approach is preferred, the overhead is acceptable
- Cognitive complexity should be kept ideally below 15
- Remove code if possible, instead of adding code
- If you create files, explain why they are not deleted, why they should stay, and how to use them
- Be generous with writing explanations for each block of code
- Please remind me to test on a separate testmachine
- Never commit on your own. Always ask before
